Hello! Welcome to N&#x00B0;5 workshop. I'm Moho. I'm a data scientist and a hobby woodworker.

# The story
I started my woodworking journey by a accident...

>When I bought my first home, the first thing I decided to do was to renovate the kitchen with IKEA. I have bought all the components and also found a kitchen fitter to do the job first day after the Easter Monday. I also took a day off on to ensure everything goes well. Then came the installation day, when I received a text message from the kitchen fitter saying that he had an serious injury when cycling during the weekend so he couldn't do the job anymore. I felt sorry for him, but it also left me in an awkward situation. I don't want to store all the flat packed furniture in my living room for god knows how long I'll find another one to do the job. Plus I had already ripped out my existing kitchen so I have nowhere to cook. After watching a few YouTube videos, I bought some tools and took the plunge to install it myself. I can still remember how I felt when I took the leap from having near zero DIY experience to installing a full fledged kitchen. Fortunately, it went ok. This gave me an enormous confidence boost, which makes me feel that if a tradesman can do it, I can do it myself.

Since then I have been gradually pulled into the woodworking rabbit hole. There is that tranquillity you feel when you are in the workshop, away from all the digital distractions, and the only thing that matters is solving the immediate challenges, like how do I make this cut and how do I join the two pieces together. Trust me, there aren't many things that are more satisfying than transforming your design from a piece of paper into a tangible object that you can feel and use.

# The journey
Woodworking is a lifetime hobby. Around my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday, I decided to document my journey to become a better woodworker. I created this website dedicated to my woodworking and DIY projects. I hope to reach out to many more people who share the passion in woodworking and creation in general. Hopefully you can also learn something new from my journey as well.
