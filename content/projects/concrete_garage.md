I have been woodworking in my shed for the past a year or so. As my skills grow, I increasingly feel it's not an ideal place to work in. The lighting was limited. There were no sound proof measures so I felt bad for working long hours in the weekends. Also the external dimension is only 2.4 x 3 m, a really small area considering a workshop especially when sharing with other garden tools and wood storage.

So I decided to build a garage on my parking space and use it as my new workshop. After some research, I decided to go with a concrete panel garage because it's relatively cheap and very fast to build. There are a lot of concrete panel garage building companies in the UK. They all offer similar services and prices. I have asked two companies, [Hanson]([https://www.hansonconcretegarages.co.uk/](https://www.hansonconcretegarages.co.uk/)) and [Nucrete]([https://nucrete.co.uk/](https://nucrete.co.uk/)), to give me a quote. In the end I went with Nucrete because they offered a slightly lower price, but most importantly they accept payment upon completion. Most concrete garage companies on the market require you to pay the full amount 2 weeks before the installation, which to me sounds a bit dodgy. What if there's a problem with the install? I doubt they will give you any refund.

Here are the specs of my garage.

- Elite garage @ 9'6 wide x 16'3 Long
- Apex roof
- UPVC fascias
- Hormann georgian style garage door
- 2'10 Hormann Steel side door
- UPVC Window-opening
- Gutters
- Real brick fronts
- Red or grey roof sheets
- 7' eaves height

Total cost was £4,599.00 delivered and installed inc VAT & Discount, as of Aug 2020.

Since the concrete garage must be installed on a flat solid surface, which I don't have, I also asked people recommended by the garage company to lay a 4'' thick concrete base. This cost me another £1,512 inc VAT.

Overall, I'm quite happy with garage. Apparently, I can't do any work straightaway inside the garage. There are a lot of works to be done inside the garage, such as applying cement fillet around the bottom, sound proofing and running electricity from the consumer unit in my home. All of these will be documented in my next [post](/projects/garage-conversion).
