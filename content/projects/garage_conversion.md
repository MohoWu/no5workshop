The concrete panel garage was built in my last [post](/projects/concrete-garage). This post documents how I converted it into a workshop. You can find the conversion process in my video above. Below is a breakdown of the costs, including the materials and labour on running electricity from my home. Adding in the cost of the concrete garage, this brings the total cost of building a garden workshop to approx. Â£8,100.
