In this video, I made an oak dovetail box.

This is my first fine woodworking project using mainly hand tools. I find it feels very different from projects using mainly power tools. I find hand tool woodworking much more relaxing and safer.

Thanks to Mat Eslea's [Free online woodworking school](https://freeonlinewoodworkingschool.com/) for providing such detailed tutorials for this project.
