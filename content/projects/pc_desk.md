In this video, I made a PC desk out of birch plywood.

I made this myself because I can't find one on the marke that will satisfy all my needs for a PC desk.

My needs for a PC desk are:

- The PC needs to sit under the desk so that it doesn't take up any desktop space.
- It needs to have some drawers for storage.
- It needs to have wheels so I can easily move around.

This plywood PC desk satisfies all my needs and it's not that complicated to build.

I have been using this desk for a few months now and I haven't found any major flaws to this design.

This desk works best when paired with an ergonomic chair with armrest, as I find the desk a bit narrow for resting my elbows when typing.
