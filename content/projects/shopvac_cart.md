In this video, I made a cart for my shop vac and dust cyclone. The design takes
inspiration from many YouTube videos, but I added my personal flavour to it as
well. I made it also functioning as an outfeed table for my table saw. When not
in use, the outfeed table can be flipped out of the way for ease of access of the
dust bin.
